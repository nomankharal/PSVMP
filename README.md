üß∞ Prerequisites and environment
- Python 3.8 or newer (cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Network access for downloads
- A PS Vita with VitaShell installed and an accessible FTP server (or USB transfer path)
- Basic command-line familiarity
- Optional: virtual environment support to isolate dependencies

üèóÔ∏è Installation and setup

- Get the code
  - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nomankharal/PSVMP.git`
  - Enter the project: `cd PSVMP`

- Install dependencies
  - With Python 3.8+: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - On some systems you may use `python3` instead of `python`

- Run a quick check
  - See available commands: `psvmp --help` or `python -m psvmp --help`
  - If you use a virtual environment, activate it first

- First-run tips
  - Create a default config if the project ships one, or copy a template
  - Customize the output directory and target Vita settings in the config
  - Ensure VitaShell FTP is accessible from your PC with the Vita on the same network

üîß Quick start: a simple end-to-end workflow

- Step 1: Prepare a media source
  - You can provide a direct media URL or a playlist feed supported by PSVMP
  - Example: `psvmp --download "https://example.com/video-source"` (adjust URL to your source)

- Step 2: Choose output and quality
  - Select Vita-friendly formats. A common choice is MP4 with H.264 video and AAC audio
  - Example: `psvmp --output "Videos" --format mp4 --video-codec h264 --audio-codec aac --quality 720p`

- Step 3: Transfer to the Vita
  - Ensure VitaShell is running and FTP transfer is enabled on your Vita
  - Example: `psvmp --transfer vita --vita-ip 192.168.1.42 --vita-user ftp --vita-pass ftp_password`
  - PSVMP negotiates with VitaShell to push the files into the Vita‚Äôs media folder

- Step 4: Verify on the Vita
  - Open VitaShell or the Vita‚Äôs Media Player to confirm the new files appear
  - Confirm playback compatibility and quality
  - If you encounter issues, review logs and adjust the profile for better compatibility

- Step 5: Save and reuse the workflow
  - Save the current settings as a profile for future runs
  - Use a batch script or a cron job to automate repeated tasks

üëü Step-by-step workflow design

- Download stage
  - Accept various sources: direct URLs, playlists, or search results
  - Respect source rights and terms of service
  - Respect rate limits and retry logic for reliability

- Conversion stage
  - Target formats: MP4 (H.264) for video, AAC for audio
  - Recommended resolutions: 720p when possible, 480p for older Vita units
  - Frame rate: 24‚Äì30 fps for smooth playback without unnecessary load
  - Bitrate guidance: 2‚Äì5 Mbps for video, 128‚Äì192 kbps for audio, depending on content
  - Subtitles: optional, support is limited on Vita; prefer embedded subtitles if needed

- Transfer stage
  - Transfer over FTP is common with VitaShell
  - Ensure the Vita is reachable on the local network
  - Use progressive transfer to handle large files gracefully
  - Verify integrity post-transfer, if possible

- Post-processing
  - Move files into Vita-friendly folders
  - Clean up temporary files
  - Log results for auditing and troubleshooting

üß© Customization and profiles

- Profiles are your friend. Create profiles for different devices, content types, or network setups.
- A profile might include:
  - Source type and location
  - Output directory and naming scheme
  - Video and audio codecs, bitrate, and container
  - Target Vita settings (screen size, aspect ratio, framerate)
  - Transfer method details (FTP server, credentials, destination path)

- Example profile concepts
  - Profile: VitaMainstream
    - Source: direct URL or playlist
    - Format: MP4
    - Video: H.264, 720p, 30fps, 3 Mbps
    - Audio: AAC, 128 kbps
    - Output path: /VitaMedia/Video
    - Transfer: Vita FTP to /mnt/sdcard/VitaMedia/Video

- Saving and reusing profiles reduces setup time for new tasks

üß™ Formats, codecs, and Vita compatibility

- Video
  - Preferred: H.264 encoded video in an MP4 container
  - Supported resolutions: commonly 720p for Vita compatibility
  - Frame rate: 24‚Äì30 fps typically works well

- Audio
  - Preferred: AAC-LC
  - Sample rate: 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz
  - Bitrate: 128‚Äì192 kbps for a balance of quality and size

- Containers and compatibility
  - MP4 is the most interoperable container for Vita
  - MKV may be playable in some setups but MP4 is safer
  - Subtitles: optional and not widely supported on Vita; consider hardcoding if needed

- Quality and size trade-offs
  - Higher resolution and bitrate mean larger files
  - Balance quality with the Vita‚Äôs storage capacity and playback performance

üóÇÔ∏è Working with configurations and files

- Default config
  - PSVMP ships with a default template you can customize
  - Place custom config in your user directory or a project-specific folder

- Naming and organization
  - Use descriptive folder names like Year-Month_Title or Series_Title_Episode
  - Maintain a consistent naming scheme for easy sorting on Vita

- Logging and traces
  - Enable verbose logging during first runs to understand behavior
  - Log files help you reproduce a successful workflow or diagnose issues

- Error handling
  - PSVMP should continue on non-fatal errors, logging a clear message
  - If a download fails, the system retries a configurable number of times
  - If a transfer fails, a retry or fallback to a secondary method is available

üß≠ How PSVMP talks to the Vita

- VitaShell FTP interface
  - The Vita acts as an FTP server in most setups
  - Ensure the Vita and PC share the same network segment
  - Username and password are set in VitaShell, then supplied to PSVMP

- USB transfer
  - If you use USB transfer, PSVMP uses a direct path when available
  - USB can be slower; network transfers are generally faster on a modern setup

- File placement on Vita
  - Place media in Vita‚Äôs standard media folders
  - Use VitaShell‚Äôs browser to verify exact destination folders
  - Ensure file permissions on Vita don‚Äôt block playback

- Verification
  - After transfer, verify file integrity and readability on Vita
  - If a file doesn‚Äôt appear, recheck the destination path and names

üß≠ Real-world scenarios and workflows

- Scenario A: Daily video dumps
  - Source: a weekly video feed
  - Output: MP4, 720p, 3 Mbps
  - Transfer: Vita FTP to /mnt/sdcard/VitaMedia/Video
  - Schedule: run every Sunday at 03:00 using cron or Task Scheduler

- Scenario B: Music library refresh
  - Source: audio playlist
  - Output: MP3 with appropriate bitrate
  - Transfer: Vita FTP to /mnt/sdcard/VitaMedia/Music
